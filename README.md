# DPGNN-GasLeak
Code and data for replicating the work in ‘Towards deep probabilistic graph neural network for natural gas leak detection and localization without labeled anomaly data’ by Zhang et al. (2023). The paper proposes a deep probabilistic graph neural network for modeling spatial sensor dependency and localizing natural gas leaks.
